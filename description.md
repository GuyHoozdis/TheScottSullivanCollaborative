## Description

A collection of individuals with the common moniker, "Scott Sullivan".

Why?  I'm curious what will erupt from the collective conscious formed by a
concentration of Scott Sullivan's.  It could be awesome, like Voltron, a
cohesive and powerful entity greater than the sum of its parts... or it could
be pure debauchery.  Either way, I want to see what happens.

I seem to be noticing more-and-more Scott Sullivan's in the news as the years
have gone on.  It started with the CFO of WorldCom-  "Bad Sully", as I call
him, went to jail for his involvement in the accounting practices used at
WorldCom (it was a mini Enron).  After that the Philidelphia Pirates pitcher
came into public view- "Pirate Sully".

Even today those are the two names that tend to be at the top of search
results for our name.  In more recent years the name-sharing-gentlemen that I
have come across tend to be shown in considerably better light than Bad Sully
was-  he tarnished our brand, but does not represent the prevailing essence of
an individual named "Scott Sullivan".

I'm happy to say that you are, we are, predominately savvy businessmen and
technology entrepreneurs who often are in the news for their leadership or
involvement with a socially motivated project for their community.  I'm glad
to be finding these stories and it was got me wondering... what would happen
if...
