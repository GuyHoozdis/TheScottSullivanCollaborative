## Sully's Mob Rules

1. Your name must be Scott Sullivan to join.
1. Subgroups with matching middle names may form alliances.
1. A yet to be announced game will ensue.
   * The game will begin in digital space
   * The game is likely to end in physical space (Next SWSX?)
1. All Scott Sullivan's will dawn name tags and similar attire; subgroups may
   add variations for subgroup identification
   * All Will answer to "Sully"
   * Asian School girls actors will be hired to follow us around.
1. We will rent Segways and ride them as a gang.
1. We will recreate the landscape, characters, vehicles, and groupies in a
   Second-Life/Google Earth type relm
   * Virtual activity will mimic real time
   * We mob bars, entering single file... sending one man early to order 50
     Irish car bombs...
   * We are poured the stream of sullies continues file into the bar until we
     break into a thundering Celtic chant & chug.
   * Everybody scatters as the groupies suddenly "find us"
   * "Mad Russian" should be the signal before we leap into action.


Ok, I haven't actually designed all the game yet, but this is what I'm
thinking.  I imagine we must cover quite a gamut of skills and abilities.
Lets design a location based game (a spy game?) have physical world - half
virtual.  Servers stored at certain sites can be physical compromised, Salesmen
have specific tasks they have to talk people into doing (maybe for bonus points
or something).

Throughout the year we should compete raising money.
