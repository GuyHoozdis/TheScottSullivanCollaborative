# The Scott Sullivan Collaborative

It's a silly idea, but every time I think about it there is no end to the joy
it brings me - a group comprised of individuals all having the legal name
_Scott Sullivan_.

There is only one problem.  A group needs more than one member to actually be a
group.  Technically, I've only created space for a group to form.  Oh, and I
invited qualified members.  I just appear to be the only Scott Sullivan that
thinks this is a good idea.

Perhaps it was because I have been so critical of the CFO of WorldCOM; that is,
the one named _Scott Sullivan_. I admit that I was quick to judge and now I
think that was a mistake. It was U.S. District Judge Barbra Jones' job to
pass judgement. Moreover, he paid for his transgressions. It's time to move
forward.
